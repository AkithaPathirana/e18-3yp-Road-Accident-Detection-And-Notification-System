# Road Accident Detection And Notification System
___

A motor car accident can happen to anyone of us at any given moment. If you’re lucky then you’ll survive without a scratch. But sometimes you may be too shocked to act rationally or you may be unconscious with serious damages. Unfortunately in such situations, it takes an unacceptably long time for an ambulance to attend to you.
This is the main reason why most people pass away. Those critical minutes/seconds just after an accident can save countless lives if the first responders arrive soon enough and the police is notified quickly enough to get rid of other haphazards. And that is the problem that we are trying to solve through our project.
